# Blackjack

## Overview

The goal of blackjack (or 21) is for the player to draw cards with a value of 21 (or close to 21) without going over (bust/break). He/she is only playing against the dealer (the house) and has to beat the dealer's hand in order to win.

### The rules are simple:

1. Have a card total value greater than that of the dealer and not "bust".
2. Win by "default" if the dealer "busts".

A player can:

1. "Hit"; the player wants to receive an additional card, or
2. "Stay"; the player feels they are close to 21 and no longer wants additional cards (the player stays with his/her two initial cards)

### Card values

- Numbered cards; cards numbered 2 through 10 are worth their face value.
- Face cards; face cards (King - K, Queen - Q, Jack - J) are worth 10 points each.
- Ace; the ace is either worth 1 or 11
